                <p class="lead">
                    {{ brand }} was conceived by two scientists at the University
                    of California, San Francisco in 2015, who felt a need for
                    automated literature searches that save time, are personalized,
                    and never miss an important publication from an ever increasing
                    variety of news sources. {{ brand }}
                    came to life as a web application.
                </p>

                    to maintain automated searches by topics or authors that quickly
                    become outdated. Nor do you need to sort through search results
                    to find the most relevant publications in your fields of interest.<br>
