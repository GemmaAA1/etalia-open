                <h3 class="question">How can I use PubStream?</h3>
                <p class="lead response">
                    To use PubStream you need access to the internet and an account with a reference
                    library (e.g. <a href="www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> or <a href="www.mendeley.com">Mendeley</a>).
                    Use your reference library credentials to sign in to PubStream
                    and start browsing your personal stream of recommended publications.
                </p>
                <h3 class="question">Why PubStream only support Zotero and Mendeley?</h3>
                <p class="lead response">
                    <a href="www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> and <a href="www.mendeley.com">Mendeley</a> are the only two reference software managers that are cloud-based and provide
                    the ability for third party application, like PubStream, to access your library content
                    through authentication. Both use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">
                    OAuth protocol</a>, which is a widely adopted, open protocol for users to delegate
                    authorization in a secure manner. OAuth is used to authorize requests between PubStream
                    and your reference managers.<br> PubStream will serve other reference managers as
                    support for OAuth is added.
                </p>
                <h3 class="question">What makes PubStream and Google Scholar different?</h3>

                    PubStream recommends publications based on the content of your reference
                    library unlike Google Scholar, which makes suggestions based on your publication
                    and citation records only.
                </p>
                <h3 class="question">How often are recommendations updated?</h3>
                <p class="lead response">

                <h3 class="question">Which publications sources are fetched by PubStream?</h3>
                <p class="lead response">
                    Currently, PubStream fetches publications available on
                    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">PubMed</a>, the <a href="http://http://arxiv.org/">
