        In order for you to create an account on Etalia and use our services,
        we need to collect and process some information. Depending on your use
        of the Services, that may include:

            <li>information (such as your name, email) that you provide by
                completing forms on Etalia or by sign-in through the
                third-parties providers;
            </li>
            <li>
                your login and password details, in connection with the account
                sign-in process;
            </li>
            <li>
                details of any requests or transactions you make through the Services;
            </li>
            <li>
                communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for
                support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);
            </li>
            <li>
                information that you submit to Etalia in the form of comments,
                contributions to discussions, or messages to other users.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>What’s Private</h2>

        <p>
            This data will not be publicly displayed or revealed to other users:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                any payment information you provide
            </li>
            <li>
                your password details
            </li>
            <li>
                your IP address
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for
                support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We don’t give your personal information to any third-party services.</p>

    <h2>What’s Only Shared with Etalia</h2>

        <p>When you sign-in to Etalia using third-party authentication service
            (like Mendeley or Zotero), you are granting Etalia access to the
            documents that you store in your personal reference manager. These
            documents are used to define your user profile that enable Etalia Services.
            These documents are not shared with any third-party services and are
            not publicly available.
        </p>

    <h2>What’s Public</h2>


    <p>When you sign-in to Etalia, we create a basic profile page that contains
        your account name, the date the account was created, and, if available
        through the third-party authentication services, your photo, your
        affiliation and the list of your scientific contributions. Whenever your
        account name appears on Etalia (for instance, when you post comments or
        create threads), people can click your account name to see your profile.
        Here are some of the things that will be publicly viewable on your profile,
        or elsewhere on Etalia:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Your first and last names, and the date it was created
        </li>
        <li>
            Possibly your photo and affiliation if reported by the third-party authentication service.
        </li>
        <li>
            any information you choose to add to your profile (like a bio, or your location)
        </li>
        <li>
            your scientific contributions
        </li>
        <li>
            threads, posts, comments that you have created
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        If you don’t want others to see your name or profile image, choose an
        account image or name that is not identifiable (e.g., AlbEin007).
    </p>

    <h2>Uses of Your Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
        We will use the personal information you provide to:

        </li>
        <li>
            send you marketing communications we think you may find useful, but only
            in accordance with your email preferences;
        </li>
        <li>
            present projects to you when you use the Services which we believe
            will be of interest based on your interests;

            analyze the use of the Services and the people visiting to improve
            our content and Services;
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We take securing your data and preserving your privacy very seriously.
        We never post anything to your Facebook, Twitter, or other third-party
        accounts without your permission. We do not and will not sell your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Email</h2>

    <p>
        We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. We try
        to keep emails to a minimum and give you the ability to opt out of any
        marketing communications we send.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may send you service-related announcements on the rare occasions when
        it is necessary to do so.
    </p>

    <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
        <p>
            To modify or delete the personal information you have provided to us,
            please log in and update your profile.
        </p>
        <p>
            On request, we will give you a copy of all the personal information
            about you that we hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Information that you submit through the Services may be transferred
            to countries other than where you reside (for example, to our
            servers in the United States). We will protect all information we
            receive in accordance with this privacy policy.
        </p>
