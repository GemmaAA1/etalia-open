        <h1>About</h1>

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
            {{ brand }} was conceived by two scientists who felt the need for
            new ways in scholarly communication. The idea of an intelligent
            platform was born to discover new publications, connect with experts
            for
            discussions, comments and reviews, and disseminate oneâ€™s own
            writings.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            {{ brand }} checks what you are reading in your personal reference
            library (e.g. <a href="www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> or <a
                href="www.mendeley.com">Mendeley</a>) and - based on the library
            content - generates a personal text fingerprint (PTF) as a
            representation of your areas of interests. To understand your
            interests, {{ brand }} uses recent advances in natural language
            processing, machine learning, and statistics. By matching your PTF
            with the text fingerprints of publications and other public texts,
            {{ brand }} provides you with a personalized news stream and lets
            you
            engage in content-driven scholarly exchanges.

        <h2>Keep up with new publications</h2>
        <p>
            With {{ brand }}, you automatically receive a personalized listing
            of new
            scientific publications within your areas of interests. You can
            upload the publications to your personal library, share them with
            friends and collaborators via social media, as well as dismiss
            publications that are less relevant to you. Based on your activity,
            {{ brand }} learns and refines your literature searches.
        </p>

        <h2>Discover</h2>
        <p>
            {{ brand }} lets you discover trending publications and hot topics
            in your area of interest and beyond based on the
            <a href="http://www.altmetric.com/">Altmetric</a>&trade; score.
        </p>

            communicate with experts on specific topics, such as ask questions,
