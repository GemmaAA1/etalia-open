    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>
        {{ brand }} was conceived by two scientists at the University
        of California, San Francisco in 2015, who felt a need for
        automated literature searches that save time, are personalized,
        and never miss an important publication from an ever increasing
        variety of news sources. {{ brand }}
        came to life as a web application.
    </p>

    <h2>A new way of searches</h2>
    <p>
        With {{ brand }},
        you don’t have to setup keywords for searches or
        manually browse journal websites and blogs. You also don’t have
        to maintain automated searches by topics or authors that quickly
        become outdated. Nor do you need to sort through search results
        to find the most relevant publications in your fields of interest.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        {{ brand }}
        delivers scientific news that matches your personalized interest,
        completely automated and ranked by relevance, saving you time and
        ensuring no relevant paper is missed.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
        {{ brand }} checks what you are reading in your Reference Library
        (e.g. <a href="www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> or <a href="www.mendeley.com">Mendeley</a>).
        {{ brand }} leverages the content of your library using recent advances in natural
        language processing, machine learning, and statistics to understand your interests.
        {{ brand }} builds news streams that match your personal interests based on
        your library text content. Reading a new paper or extending your research interests?
        {{ brand }} will automatically adapt.
    </p>

    <h2>Many tools in one place</h2>
    <p>
        With {{ brand }}, you can retrieve new publications from journals,
        upload them to your library, share them with friends and collaborators
        via social media, and more.
    </p>

    <h2>Discover</h2>
    <p>
        {{ brand }} lets you discover trending publications and hot topics
        in your area of interest and beyond based on the
        <a href="http://www.altmetric.com/">Altmetric</a> score.
