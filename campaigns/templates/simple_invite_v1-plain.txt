Hi,

We are two researchers who think that more can be done to disseminate scientific
discoveries and empower scholarly dialogues. To go beyond traditional limits, we have
launched Etalia (etalia.io).


With Etalia you can receive personalized article recommendations and join
scholarly dialogues around subject matters. Specifically, Etalia uses your
“text-fingerprint” based on your personal reference library.
Currently we are supporting two library managers: Mendeley and Zotero.


Etalia is free and it saves you time.
Check it out at etalia.io.


We would like to hear from you because your feedback really matters to improve Etalia.
Tell us what you think at contact@etalia.io or come chat with us directly on Etalia.


We are looking forward seeing you on Etalia,


Team Etalia
