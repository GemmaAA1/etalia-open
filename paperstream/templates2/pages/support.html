                {{ brand }} leverages the content of your library using recent advances
                in natural language processing, machine learning, and statistics
                to understand your interests. {{ brand }} builds news streams that
                match your personal interests based on your library text content.

                the ability for third party application, like {{ brand }}, to access your library content
                through authentication. Both use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">
                OAuth protocol</a>, which is a widely adopted, open protocol for users to delegate
                authorization in a secure manner. OAuth is used to authorize requests between {{ brand }}
                and your reference managers.<br> {{ brand }} will serve other reference managers as
                support for OAuth is added.
