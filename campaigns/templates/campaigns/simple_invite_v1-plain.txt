Hi,

We think that more can be done to disseminate scientific discoveries and
empower scholarly dialogues. To go beyond traditional limits, we have
launched Etalia (etalia.io).


With Etalia you can receive personalized article recommendations and join
scholarly dialogues around subject matters. Specifically, Etalia uses your
“text-fingerprint” based on your personal reference library.
Currently we are supporting two library managers: Mendeley and Zotero.


Etalia is free. Check it out at etalia.io.


We would love to hear from you because your feedback really matters to improve Etalia.
Please contact us at contact@etalia.io or chat with us directly on Etalia.


I am looking forward seeing you on Etalia,


Nicolas
Team Etalia
